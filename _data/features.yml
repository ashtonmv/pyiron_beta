    content: "<p>The pyiron IDE is built on top of an abstract class of Python
        objects, which can be combined like building blocks.</p>
        <p>So switching from density functional theory (VASP, SPHInX) to
        interatomic potentials (LAMMPS) is as easy as changing a variable.</p>"

    content: "<p>Inside the pyiron IDE, simulation protocols are developed in Jupyter
        notebooks, which can be submitted to a remote HPC cluster as ScriptJobs.</p>
        <p>This enables studying trends in the periodic table following the map-reduce
        pattern using the pyironTable object to aggregate the results in a single
        pandas Dataframe.</p>"

        <p>The pyiron IDE also supports advanced users, exposing direct access to all
        the inputs and outputs of the underlying simulation codes.</p>"
