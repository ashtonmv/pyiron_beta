    header: Generic Interface
    content: "<p>The pyiron IDE is built on top of an abstract class of Python objects,
    which can be combined like building blocks.</p><p>So switching from density functional
    theory (VASP, SPHInX) to interatomic potentials (LAMMPS) is as easy as changing
    a variable.</p>"

    header: Up-scaling
    content: "<p>To up-scale the interactive calculation to HPC pyiron implements the
    server object. This enables studying trends e.g. in the periodic table.</p><p>The resulting
    large datasets can be quickly analyzed using the map-reduce pattern: The pyironTable
    object aggregates the results in a single pandas Dataframe.</p>"

    header: Extendability
    content: "<p>New simulation codes can be added easily to the pyiron IDE either by
    using the Python bindings (see example below) or by defining a <code class='inline'>write_input</code> and a
    <code class='inline'>collect_output</code> function to parse the input and output files of the executable.</p>"
