    Pyiron (pronounced "py-ron") is developed in the Computational
    Materials Design department of Joerg Neugebauer at the Max
    Planck Institut für Eisenforschung (Max Planck Institute
    for iron research) in Düsseldorf, Germany. While its
    original focus was to provide a framework to develop and
    run complex simulation protocols as needed for ab initio
    thermodynamics, it quickly evolved into a versatile tool
    to manage a wide variety of simulation tasks. In 2016 the
    Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation
    (ICAMS) joined the development of the framework with a
    specific focus on high throughput applications. In 2018,
    pyiron was released as open-source project.</p>

    pyiron is an integrated development environment (IDE) for
    implementing, testing, and running simulations in computational
    materials science. It combines several tools in a common platform:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Atomic structure objects</strong> – compatible to the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Atomistic simulation codes</strong> – like LAMMPS and VASP.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Feedback Loops</strong> – to construct dynamic simulation life cycles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Hierarchical data management</strong> – interfacing with storage resources like SQL and HDF5.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Integrated visualization</strong> – based on NGLview.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Interactive simulation protocols</strong> - based on Jupyter notebooks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Object oriented job management</strong> – for scaling complex simulation protocols from single jobs to high-throughput simulations.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
