---
<ol>
    <li><p>
        Start the MyBinder instance <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyiron/pyiron/master" target="_blank">here.</a>
        The bootup can take 2-5 minutes as it installs the latest (beta) version of pyiron from the repository.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Open the first_steps notebook and follow the tutorial at your own pace.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Experiment with your own modifications and new code!
        You can even create a new notebook from scratch on the MyBinder instance -
        just be aware that MyBinder is meant for testing, so once you close the
        instance your changes will be lost.
